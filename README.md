# Pet Adoption System 🐶🐱

A simple **Java OOP project** that simulates a pet adoption system.  
Users can view available pets (dogs & cats), and adopters can adopt them.  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Main.java` → runs the program
- `Pet.java` → parent class for pets
- `Dog.java` → Dog class extending Pet
- `Cat.java` → Cat class extending Pet
- `Adopter.java` → represents a user adopting pets

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac *.java


🌱 Future Improvements
 - Improve the OOP Structure by making another class handle the adoption
 - Save adopters and pets using file handling 
 - Add a database (SQL) for persistence 
 - Create a GUI version with JavaFX or Swing
